/**
 * TypeScript migration rules
 * ==========================

 * you migrate an existing project to TypeScript.

	/**
	 * Please include a short description of the rule. For rules that downgrade or
	 * disable errors, include a brief justification or reasoning.
	 *
	 * NOTE: Before disabling a rule, first consider keeping it and/or downgrading
	 * it to a warning. This allows the rule to surface helpful advice in your
	 * editor and nudge you towards best practices, but will not fail your lint
	 * step while you work to migrate your codebase.
	 *
	 * An example is the `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` rule, which is set
	 * to `warning` in the `@typescript-eslint/recommended` preset and is
	 * intentionally not overridden here.
